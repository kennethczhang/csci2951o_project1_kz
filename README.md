Optimization plans:

- update sat data structure to track var to clauses
    - using watched literals
    - new idea: assign all vars and if no conflict, then SAT


- backtracing logic

- conflict driven clause learning (part of backtracking)


backtracking later:
- search heuristic can be
    - conflict driven
    - one of the weights he said in beginning
- restart poliicy
- smarter non-chronological back tracking ?

Done:
